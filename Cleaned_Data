41,23,Leonardo Lopez Perez,14,MkLeo,T1,Mexico,267.0,0.69,"BioLeonardo ""MKLeo"" Lopez Perez is a professional Super Smash Bros. player from  Mexico. 
MKLeo's relationship with Super Smash Bros began early on as his brother ran local tournaments, while his cousins were some of the best Smash players in Mexico.
Leo's earliest victories were in Super Smash Bros Brawl at the age of 8, thereafter gaining serious recognition for knocking out Mr. R, who was a runner-up at the EVO 2016 tournament Super Smash Bros event, at the Smash Factor 4 tournament. After that, Leo's consistency improved with getting 5th place at the Get On My Level 2016 tournament, then winning Smash Factor 5 and Canada Cup 2016.
However, Leo had a hurdle to cross in Super Smash Bros player ZeRo, who constantly stopped him from getting first place in tournaments they both were participants in. This changed after the 2GGT Zero Saga tournament where he got the better of his long-time rival and ended up winning the event. This set him further on the path of becoming the best Smash player in the world. While ZeRo still won many sets against Leo, Leo ended up beating ZeRo in another 2GGT tournament, not long after ZeRo retired from competitive Smash, drawing the rivalry to a close.
The release of Super Smash Bros Ultimate marked a bit of a slump in MKLeo's performance but that all changed when he settled into playing Joker. Initially, it was a challenge because Joker is very different from his normal characters, like Lucina, Ike, Meta Knight, or Wolf, but once he got control of the character, he made Joker look broken. In the 2021 SWT: Central America Ultimate Regional Finals, Leo's use of Byleth during the event upheld the opinion of the character being an unlikely high tier.  
Some of Leo's achievements include winning GENESIS 4 and 5, Umebura Japan Major, DreamHack Atlanta 2017, Smash Factor 6, Super Smash Con 2017/2018, and 2GG: Kongo Saga among many others.

Knee was always a fan of fighting games and used to play anything he could get his hands onto. However, with time, other franchises started to fade away or lose their presence in arcades while Tekken was going strong, which made Knee focus mainly on the Tekken franchise. Back then the concept of a professional player didn't really exist so Knee's main goal was ""to be the best in Korea"".
Eventually, Knee overshot that goal, becoming not just the best player in Korea but the best in the world, until finding a formidable rival in the face of Arslan Ash.
Even then, there's no player out there who can compare with Knee's extensive record of victories, game knowledge, and character mastery. One of his famous strengths is being able to play a wide variety of characters at high-level tournaments. While Bryan is his main and long time favorite character, Knee has been seen using Devil Jin, Steve, Paul, Feng, Dragunov, and many others during major events. Be it Tekken 5, Tekken Tag Tournament 2 or Tekken 7, he always remained a consistently fearsome competitor.
Some of his best results include winning EVO 2013, EVO Japan 2018, Combo Breaker 2018/2019, Tokyo Tekken Masters 2018, 2nd place at EVO 2016 and 2019. However, even when Knee doesn't take the 1st or top 3 placement, it's still rare for him to end up outside of top 8 for any tournament he enters.

Daigo wasn't active at that period in time, but Bonchan played a lot of SF and knew who he was. This led to them casually hanging out and playing Street Fighter and becoming friends.

Eventually, he got fed up with mahjong and decided to step into professional gaming. Bonchan's playstyle is similar to his lifestyle. He's a calm, patient, and goal-oriented person. In real life that translated to him setting a goal for himself and working towards it with diligence and dedication. During the game, it shows in his defensive plays that seek to condition his opponent and calculated decisions that led to many impressive comebacks.

JDCR was just 8 years old when he first visited the arcade and gained a passion for fighting games. At first, he played the King of Fighters series until KoF 2000. His interest in Tekken began when he was 14 years old when his brother introduced him to Tekken Tag Tournament. That's also when he came up with his nickname, ""JDCR"" an abbreviation of a Korean phrase that denotes him playing many characters. At some point, JDCR became so good at the game that he would get beaten up in real life for constantly beating other people in the game, but he didn't let that discourage him.
At the age of 20, JDCR started entering local tournaments and by 22, he had won a regional qualifier that would allow him to compete at a major tournament in Hong Kong. Despite being drafted for conscription service, he was allowed to travel for the tournament and ended up winning it. This kickstarted his competitive career, as he received many invitations for other tournaments. As a result, much of his military service was spent competing in Tekken.
After that, he kept competing while finishing his chemistry degree in college. At some point after his graduation, Echo Fox called JDCR and he signed up to become a professional fighting games player.
JDCR proved himself to be an amazing competitor with an impressive record behind his back. He was a champion at EVO 2017, Combo Breaker 2017, NorCal StrongStyle 6, Electric Cancel 2019, DreamHack Montreal 2019, and others. On top of that, he has many top 4 and top 8 finishes in major tournaments including 3rd place at EVO 2021 Online Tekken 7 - Asia East and Season 1 of WePlay Ultimate Fighting League Tekken 7.
One of his defining features is a high level of execution, fundamentals, and game knowledge, which allowed him to achieve good results with off-meta characters like Armor King and Heihachi, both of which rarely see play in big tournaments.

The highlight of his performance with the character is the amazing comeback during The MIXUP 2019 tournament, where on a last pixel of health, he performed an incredibly damaging, high execution combo while playing against Chikurin. That match alone brought a lot of attention to Akuma's strength and demands to nerf the character.

Jimmy ""Jimmyjtran"" Tran, also knows as Mr. Naps is a professional Tekken player from the USA. Before Tekken, Jimmy was competitive in Street Fighter: Third Strike where he was a great Urien player and SSF4 where he mained Viper.
Jimmy is unquestionably the best Bryan player in the western region and the only rival he has on the world level is Knee himself. His playstyle is reserved and safe. Jimmy has a lot of experience with Tekken and extreme mastery of Bryan so his gameplan largely revolves around the purist form of Tekken with reliance on game knowledge, character matchups, strategy, execution, and fundamentals. He is also a very dedicated character loyalist. When asked about the viability of sticking to Bryan, Jimmy replied that every character has what it takes to win and Bryan is his favorite character.
Jimmyjtran is often cited as one of the very best players in the USA and for a good reason. His history in Tekken is marked with successful performances and wins over venerated Korean pros. Jimmyjtran won Kumite in Texas 2019, The Pinnacle 2019, The King of Iron Fist Tournament North America Final 2016 and Tekken World Tour 2017 Americas Regionals.

Japanese fighting game player Naoto ""sako"" Sako, also known as sakonoko is one of the ""five gods"" of Japanese Street Fighter, with several wins under his belt that span multiple titles in the franchise. As a result, his mains have changed over the years, but in 2019 sako dropped his Chun-Li for Akuma.
Sako is a Capcom Cup 2013 champion (Street Fighter IV) who represents FAV gaming. He's mainly known for being an execution master, making the execution of complicated combos look easy. Other fighting games he's had success in are Darkstalkers, Guilty Gear XX, Hyper Street Fighter II, and Street Fighter III: Third Strike. However, it was across the different iterations of Street Fighter IV that sako truly shone, inspiring the term Sako Combo for his execution of complicated Evil Ryu combos at major events when the pressure was high. Sako maintains this impeccable consistency and high execution while being over 40 years old, shattering the preconceptions about retirement age for FGC players.
This proficiency led to HORI taking input from sako when designing their Hayabusa fighting stick parts. Hayabusa lever and buttons are usually noted for their low resistance and precision. 
Besides Akuma and Chun-Li, the master of execution has mained Menat, another Street Fighter V character with big execution requirements to play. sako's Street Fighter V accolades include a 1st place finish at SoCal Regionals 2018, 5-6th place finish at Fighter's Spirit 2019, and a 3rd place finish at EVO Japan 2020.

This world-renowned player used to be a below-average student in school attending extra classes outside of the curriculum. This led to a lot of stress which he blew off at the arcade, finding an outlet in Tekken. The game made him forget about the stress and was something he was confident about. This continued even after he was done with middle school.
Nobi became so obsessed with Tekken that he'd skip classes to play the game until he ended up dropping out of high school to play. He did homeschooling online and later applied for a programming degree in a university but had to quit it as well cause he was too obsessed with Tekken.

Daigo took an interest in fighting games early on. When he was just 10 years old he saw Street Fighter 2 arcade cabinet at a video rental store and it caught his eye. After that, he started going to arcades to play fighting games. Daigo didn't have a natural talent for fighting games but what he had is passion. He was convinced that he can win if he converts that passion into practicing and learning. This conviction would bear fruit as later on Daigo established a legendary record of having 286 win streak in Darkstalkers, only stopping because game center was closing.
The late 90s were filled with competition for Daigo, ramping up from regional to international wins when he traveled to the USA in 1998 for Street Fighter Alpha 3 tournament, where he defeated American champion, Alex Valle and won his first international championship.
While Umehara always played a variety of games, Street Fighter was always his key discipline. This culminated in EVO 2004 where he accomplished what most would consider almost impossible. In a Daigo vs Justin Wong fight, he made an incredible comeback by parrying Chun-Li's 16 hit super, which was the only option he had, because blocking would lead to chip out death. This event is now known as EVO moment 37. The same year, Daigo was unsure if he should continue playing fighting games and almost withdrawn from the community to pursue a career in elder care instead. 
Street Fighter IV release is what started drawing Daigo back into the competition and before long, he once against entered competitions, even attending and winning EVO 2009 which led to him finally becoming a sponsored player under MAD CATZ. The following year he won again at EVO 2010.
While his performance in Street Fighter V hasn't been as dominant, he remains a very intimidating opponent for other players with many top 4 and top 8 placements and incredible plays. Despite Daigo's age, which is above the average of other SF pros, he still learns and improves.
In 2016 Daigo Umehara published a book called ""The Will to Keep Winning"" that served as a peek inside the mind of a champion. It recounts both his personal life and professional career and allows people to understand his mentality that led to becoming one of the greatest fighting game players of all time.

Despite the losses it brought, he kept improving until achieving success, most notably, winning The King of Iron Fist Tournament 2016 using Jack.

He's recognized as one of the best Tekken players in North America and coined the infamous ""no round brown"" phrase after the infamous FT5 set against RealLaw. He currently represents Nfinite.
Pokchop's introduction was Tekken 2 but only really got into the game with Tekken 3 with help of his cousin. Even though many know him as a strong Bryan and Bruce player, he always liked Bruce Lee inspired characters, like Tekken's Law or Street Fighter's Fei Long.
With Tekken 4 Ricky started to get into a competitive side of Tekken and mainly focused on Bryan despite Law being his favourite. This trend of character choices continued with him later picking up Bruce in Tekken 5. 
Outside of fighting games, Pokchop also plays chess and said that sometimes it affects how he plays Tekken. Whether due to chess or not, it definitely comes through in his playstyle as Pokchop has a very sharp and strategic approach to matches. Even casual players will notice this as he quickly adapts to his opponents in both offence and defence. This makes Pokchop's matches a thrill to watch as tides can turn at any moment no matter what level of opponent he faces.
Some of his best results include 1st place at The Fall Classic 2018, 2nd place at DreamHack Atlanta 2018, 3rd place at The Fall Classic 2017, 4th place at Final Round 2019, 4th place at Kumite in Tennessee 2019, and 5th place at Summer Jam 12.

Japanese fighting game player Naoto ""sako"" Sako, also known as sakonoko is one of the ""five gods"" of Japanese Street Fighter, with several wins under his belt that span multiple titles in the franchise. As a result, his mains have changed over the years, but in 2019 sako dropped his Chun-Li for Akuma.
Sako is a Capcom Cup 2013 champion (Street Fighter IV) who represents FAV gaming. He's mainly known for being an execution master, making the execution of complicated combos look easy. Other fighting games he's had success in are Darkstalkers, Guilty Gear XX, Hyper Street Fighter II, and Street Fighter III: Third Strike. However, it was across the different iterations of Street Fighter IV that sako truly shone, inspiring the term Sako Combo for his execution of complicated Evil Ryu combos at major events when the pressure was high. Sako maintains this impeccable consistency and high execution while being over 40 years old, shattering the preconceptions about retirement age for FGC players.
This proficiency led to HORI taking input from sako when designing their Hayabusa fighting stick parts. Hayabusa lever and buttons are usually noted for their low resistance and precision. 
Besides Akuma and Chun-Li, the master of execution has mained Menat, another Street Fighter V character with big execution requirements to play. sako's Street Fighter V accolades include a 1st place finish at SoCal Regionals 2018, 5-6th place finish at Fighter's Spirit 2019, and a 3rd place finish at EVO Japan 2020.

This world-renowned player used to be a below-average student in school attending extra classes outside of the curriculum. This led to a lot of stress which he blew off at the arcade, finding an outlet in Tekken. The game made him forget about the stress and was something he was confident about. This continued even after he was done with middle school.
Nobi became so obsessed with Tekken that he'd skip classes to play the game until he ended up dropping out of high school to play. He did homeschooling online and later applied for a programming degree in a university but had to quit it as well cause he was too obsessed with Tekken. At that point, he was already competing in local tournaments and making a name for himself which steadily grew into a career in fighting games and becoming one of the best players in the world and Japan especially.

Daigo took an interest in fighting games early on. When he was just 10 years old he saw Street Fighter 2 arcade cabinet at a video rental store and it caught his eye. After that, he started going to arcades to play fighting games. Daigo didn't have a natural talent for fighting games but what he had is passion. He was convinced that he can win if he converts that passion into practicing and learning. This conviction would bear fruit as later on Daigo established a legendary record of having 286 win streak in Darkstalkers, only stopping because game center was closing.
The late 90s were filled with competition for Daigo, ramping up from regional to international wins when he traveled to the USA in 1998 for Street Fighter Alpha 3 tournament, where he defeated American champion, Alex Valle and won his first international championship.
While Umehara always played a variety of games, Street Fighter was always his key discipline. This culminated in EVO 2004 where he accomplished what most would consider almost impossible. In a Daigo vs Justin Wong fight, he made an incredible comeback by parrying Chun-Li's 16 hit super, which was the only option he had, because blocking would lead to chip out death. This event is now known as EVO moment 37. The same year, Daigo was unsure if he should continue playing fighting games and almost withdrawn from the community to pursue a career in elder care instead. 
Street Fighter IV release is what started drawing Daigo back into the competition and before long, he once against entered competitions, even attending and winning EVO 2009 which led to him finally becoming a sponsored player under MAD CATZ. The following year he won again at EVO 2010.
While his performance in Street Fighter V hasn't been as dominant, he remains a very intimidating opponent for other players with many top 4 and top 8 placements and incredible plays. Despite Daigo's age, which is above the average of other SF pros, he still learns and improves.
In 2016 Daigo Umehara published a book called ""The Will to Keep Winning"" that served as a peek inside the mind of a champion. It recounts both his personal life and professional career and allows people to understand his mentality that led to becoming one of the greatest fighting game players of all time.

He used to go to arcades throughout the years, playing Street Fighter and later on Tekken Tag Tournament 1. After graduating high school Saint stated considering a career in fighting games and competing in tournaments around the time Tekken 5: Dark Ressurection was becoming popular. At this time Saint was still considering what to do with life and with the release of Tekken Tag Tournament 2 he decided to wholly dedicate himself to the game. He started watching tournaments, analyzing pro player matches, and figuring out his shortcomings.
Despite competitive ambition, Saint's character choices are unique as his most recognisable mains are Ganryu and Jack. Despite the losses it brought, he kept improving until achieving success, most notably, winning The King of Iron Fist Tournament 2016 using Jack. Saint himself thinks that his character choice has something to do with a passion for the wrestling game he once played as a kid.
Unlike his longtime friend and teammate JDCR, Saint is also known for extensively modding his fight sticks, tuning them to perfection and making sure everything is just right. He even goes as far as trying out new parts while playing in tournaments, since the high stakes environment provides a true test of the ergonomics.

He's recognized as one of the best Tekken players in North America and coined the infamous ""no round brown"" phrase after the infamous FT5 set against RealLaw. He currently represents Nfinite.
Pokchop's introduction was Tekken 2 but only really got into the game with Tekken 3 with help of his cousin. Even though many know him as a strong Bryan and Bruce player, he always liked Bruce Lee inspired characters, like Tekken's Law or Street Fighter's Fei Long.
With Tekken 4 Ricky started to get into a competitive side of Tekken and mainly focused on Bryan despite Law being his favourite. This trend of character choices continued with him later picking up Bruce in Tekken 5. 
Outside of fighting games, Pokchop also plays chess and said that sometimes it affects how he plays Tekken. Whether due to chess or not, it definitely comes through in his playstyle as Pokchop has a very sharp and strategic approach to matches. Even casual players will notice this as he quickly adapts to his opponents in both offence and defence. This makes Pokchop's matches a thrill to watch as tides can turn at any moment no matter what level of opponent he faces.
Some of his best results include 1st place at The Fall Classic 2018, 2nd place at DreamHack Atlanta 2018, 3rd place at The Fall Classic 2017, 4th place at Final Round 2019, 4th place at Kumite in Tennessee 2019, and 5th place at Summer Jam 12.

Japanese fighting game player Naoto ""sako"" Sako, also known as sakonoko is one of the ""five gods"" of Japanese Street Fighter, with several wins under his belt that span multiple titles in the franchise. As a result, his mains have changed over the years, but in 2019 sako dropped his Chun-Li for Akuma.
Sako is a Capcom Cup 2013 champion (Street Fighter IV) who represents FAV gaming. He's mainly known for being an execution master, making the execution of complicated combos look easy. Other fighting games he's had success in are Darkstalkers, Guilty Gear XX, Hyper Street Fighter II, and Street Fighter III: Third Strike. However, it was across the different iterations of Street Fighter IV that sako truly shone, inspiring the term Sako Combo for his execution of complicated Evil Ryu combos at major events when the pressure was high. Sako maintains this impeccable consistency and high execution while being over 40 years old, shattering the preconceptions about retirement age for FGC players.
This proficiency led to HORI taking input from sako when designing their Hayabusa fighting stick parts. Hayabusa lever and buttons are usually noted for their low resistance and precision. 
Besides Akuma and Chun-Li, the master of execution has mained Menat, another Street Fighter V character with big execution requirements to play. sako's Street Fighter V accolades include a 1st place finish at SoCal Regionals 2018, 5-6th place finish at Fighter's Spirit 2019, and a 3rd place finish at EVO Japan 2020.

This led to a lot of stress which he blew off at the arcade, finding an outlet in Tekken. The game made him forget about the stress and was something he was confident about. This continued even after he was done with middle school.
Nobi became so obsessed with Tekken that he'd skip classes to play the game until he ended up dropping out of high school to play. He did homeschooling online and later applied for a programming degree in a university but had to quit it as well cause he was too obsessed with Tekken.

4,42,Daigo Umehara,1,Daigo,Red Bull eSports,Japan,83.0,0.56,"Bio Daigo ""Daigo"" Umehara sometimes also known as ""The Beast"" is a professional Street Fighter player from Japan. He is one of the ""five gods"" of fighting games, alongside Tokido, sako, Haitani and Nuki.
Daigo took an interest in fighting games early on. When he was just 10 years old he saw Street Fighter 2 arcade cabinet at a video rental store and it caught his eye. After that, he started going to arcades to play fighting games. Daigo didn't have a natural talent for fighting games but what he had is passion. He was convinced that he can win if he converts that passion into practicing and learning. This conviction would bear fruit as later on Daigo established a legendary record of having 286 win streak in Darkstalkers, only stopping because game center was closing.
The late 90s were filled with competition for Daigo, ramping up from regional to international wins when he traveled to the USA in 1998 for Street Fighter Alpha 3 tournament, where he defeated American champion, Alex Valle and won his first international championship.
While Umehara always played a variety of games, Street Fighter was always his key discipline. This culminated in EVO 2004 where he accomplished what most would consider almost impossible. In a Daigo vs Justin Wong fight, he made an incredible comeback by parrying Chun-Li's 16 hit super, which was the only option he had, because blocking would lead to chip out death. This event is now known as EVO moment 37. The same year, Daigo was unsure if he should continue playing fighting games and almost withdrawn from the community to pursue a career in elder care instead. 
Street Fighter IV release is what started drawing Daigo back into the competition and before long, he once against entered competitions, even attending and winning EVO 2009 which led to him finally becoming a sponsored player under MAD CATZ. The following year he won again at EVO 2010.

After graduating high school Saint stated considering a career in fighting games and competing in tournaments around the time Tekken 5: Dark Ressurection was becoming popular. At this time Saint was still considering what to do with life and with the release of Tekken Tag Tournament 2 he decided to wholly dedicate himself to the game. He started watching tournaments, analyzing pro player matches, and figuring out his shortcomings.
Despite competitive ambition, Saint's character choices are unique as his most recognisable mains are Ganryu and Jack. Despite the losses it brought, he kept improving until achieving success, most notably, winning The King of Iron Fist Tournament 2016 using Jack. Saint himself thinks that his character choice has something to do with a passion for the wrestling game he once played as a kid.

Pokchop's introduction was Tekken 2 but only really got into the game with Tekken 3 with help of his cousin. Even though many know him as a strong Bryan and Bruce player, he always liked Bruce Lee inspired characters, like Tekken's Law or Street Fighter's Fei Long.
With Tekken 4 Ricky started to get into a competitive side of Tekken and mainly focused on Bryan despite Law being his favourite. This trend of character choices continued with him later picking up Bruce in Tekken 5. 
Outside of fighting games, Pokchop also plays chess and said that sometimes it affects how he plays Tekken. Whether due to chess or not, it definitely comes through in his playstyle as Pokchop has a very sharp and strategic approach to matches. Even casual players will notice this as he quickly adapts to his opponents in both offence and defence. This makes Pokchop's matches a thrill to watch as tides can turn at any moment no matter what level of opponent he faces.
Some of his best results include 1st place at The Fall Classic 2018, 2nd place at DreamHack Atlanta 2018, 3rd place at The Fall Classic 2017, 4th place at Final Round 2019, 4th place at Kumite in Tennessee 2019, and 5th place at Summer Jam 12.

YUYU started playing Tekken seriously with Tekken 5: Dark Ressurection. She focused on learning frame data and small things about the game and gradually adding them to her gameplay to incrementally improve her skills. She was also aided by a group of friends that helped her out at a time when female pros and players, in general, were especially uncommon. YUYU at the time also learned of Maxi, another female player who was doing well in Tekken, the two met and it inspired YUYU to continue improving at the game and getting into competitions.
YUYU is one of the rare competitive Xiaoyu mains. She liked Xioayu because she had a cool pose and was fun to play but the first time she picked the character was due to the character select timer running out and her rushing to pick someone. However, despite being known for her Xiaoyu mastery, YUYU's favorite character is Zafina and she started using her a lot more after Zafina was added to Tekken 7. Her playstyle takes advantage of the unique evasive properties both Xiaoyu and Zafina have. While still showing strong defense and movement, YUYU is not afraid to take risks to crush or evade her opponent's move and enforce pressure.

95,23,Leonardo Lopez Perez,14,MkLeo,T1,Mexico,267.0,0.69,"BioLeonardo ""MKLeo"" Lopez Perez is a professional Super Smash Bros. player from  Mexico. 
MKLeo's relationship with Super Smash Bros began early on as his brother ran local tournaments, while his cousins were some of the best Smash players in Mexico.
Leo's earliest victories were in Super Smash Bros Brawl at the age of 8, thereafter gaining serious recognition for knocking out Mr. R, who was a runner-up at the EVO 2016 tournament Super Smash Bros event, at the Smash Factor 4 tournament. After that, Leo's consistency improved with getting 5th place at the Get On My Level 2016 tournament, then winning Smash Factor 5 and Canada Cup 2016.
However, Leo had a hurdle to cross in Super Smash Bros player ZeRo, who constantly stopped him from getting first place in tournaments they both were participants in. This changed after the 2GGT Zero Saga tournament where he got the better of his long-time rival and ended up winning the event. This set him further on the path of becoming the best Smash player in the world. While ZeRo still won many sets against Leo, Leo ended up beating ZeRo in another 2GGT tournament, not long after ZeRo retired from competitive Smash, drawing the rivalry to a close.
The release of Super Smash Bros Ultimate marked a bit of a slump in MKLeo's performance but that all changed when he settled into playing Joker. Initially, it was a challenge because Joker is very different from his normal characters, like Lucina, Ike, Meta Knight, or Wolf, but once he got control of the character, he made Joker look broken. In the 2021 SWT: Central America Ultimate Regional Finals, Leo's use of Byleth during the event upheld the opinion of the character being an unlikely high tier.  
Some of Leo's achievements include winning GENESIS 4 and 5, Umebura Japan Major, DreamHack Atlanta 2017, Smash Factor 6, Super Smash Con 2017/2018, and 2GG: Kongo Saga among many others.
