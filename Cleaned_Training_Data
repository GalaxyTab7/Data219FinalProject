41,23,Leonardo Lopez Perez,14,MkLeo,T1,Mexico,267.0,0.69,"BioLeonardo ""MKLeo"" Lopez Perez is a professional Super Smash Bros. player from  Mexico. 
MKLeo's relationship with Super Smash Bros began early on as his brother ran local tournaments, while his cousins were some of the best Smash players in Mexico.
Leo's earliest victories were in Super Smash Bros Brawl at the age of 8, thereafter gaining serious recognition for knocking out Mr. R, who was a runner-up at the EVO 2016 tournament Super Smash Bros event, at the Smash Factor 4 tournament. After that, Leo's consistency improved with getting 5th place at the Get On My Level 2016 tournament, then winning Smash Factor 5 and Canada Cup 2016.
However, Leo had a hurdle to cross in Super Smash Bros player ZeRo, who constantly stopped him from getting first place in tournaments they both were participants in. This changed after the 2GGT Zero Saga tournament where he got the better of his long-time rival and ended up winning the event. This set him further on the path of becoming the best Smash player in the world. While ZeRo still won many sets against Leo, Leo ended up beating ZeRo in another 2GGT tournament, not long after ZeRo retired from competitive Smash, drawing the rivalry to a close.
The release of Super Smash Bros Ultimate marked a bit of a slump in MKLeo's performance but that all changed when he settled into playing Joker. Initially, it was a challenge because Joker is very different from his normal characters, like Lucina, Ike, Meta Knight, or Wolf, but once he got control of the character, he made Joker look broken. In the 2021 SWT: Central America Ultimate Regional Finals, Leo's use of Byleth during the event upheld the opinion of the character being an unlikely high tier.  
Some of Leo's achievements include winning GENESIS 4 and 5, Umebura Japan Major, DreamHack Atlanta 2017, Smash Factor 6, Super Smash Con 2017/2018, and 2GG: Kongo Saga among many others.

Knee was always a fan of fighting games and used to play anything he could get his hands onto. However, with time, other franchises started to fade away or lose their presence in arcades while Tekken was going strong, which made Knee focus mainly on the Tekken franchise. Back then the concept of a professional player didn't really exist so Knee's main goal was ""to be the best in Korea"".
Eventually, Knee overshot that goal, becoming not just the best player in Korea but the best in the world, until finding a formidable rival in the face of Arslan Ash.
Even then, there's no player out there who can compare with Knee's extensive record of victories, game knowledge, and character mastery. One of his famous strengths is being able to play a wide variety of characters at high-level tournaments. While Bryan is his main and long time favorite character, Knee has been seen using Devil Jin, Steve, Paul, Feng, Dragunov, and many others during major events. Be it Tekken 5, Tekken Tag Tournament 2 or Tekken 7, he always remained a consistently fearsome competitor.
Some of his best results include winning EVO 2013, EVO Japan 2018, Combo Breaker 2018/2019, Tokyo Tekken Masters 2018, 2nd place at EVO 2016 and 2019. However, even when Knee doesn't take the 1st or top 3 placement, it's still rare for him to end up outside of top 8 for any tournament he enters.

His interest in Tekken began when he was 14 years old when his brother introduced him to Tekken Tag Tournament. That's also when he came up with his nickname, ""JDCR"" an abbreviation of a Korean phrase that denotes him playing many characters.

Despite being drafted for conscription service, he was allowed to travel for the tournament and ended up winning it. This kickstarted his competitive career, as he received many invitations for other tournaments. As a result, much of his military service was spent competing in Tekken.
After that, he kept competing while finishing his chemistry degree in college. At some point after his graduation, Echo Fox called JDCR and he signed up to become a professional fighting games player.

Whether due to chess or not, it definitely comes through in his playstyle as Pokchop has a very sharp and strategic approach to matches. Even casual players will notice this as he quickly adapts to his opponents in both offence and defence.

This world-renowned player used to be a below-average student in school attending extra classes outside of the curriculum. This led to a lot of stress which he blew off at the arcade, finding an outlet in Tekken. The game made him forget about the stress and was something he was confident about. This continued even after he was done with middle school.
Nobi became so obsessed with Tekken that he'd skip classes to play the game until he ended up dropping out of high school to play. He did homeschooling online and later applied for a programming degree in a university but had to quit it as well cause he was too obsessed with Tekken. At that point, he was already competing in local tournaments and making a name for himself which steadily grew into a career in fighting games and becoming one of the best players in the world and Japan especially.

After graduating high school Saint stated considering a career in fighting games and competing in tournaments around the time Tekken 5: Dark Ressurection was becoming popular. At this time Saint was still considering what to do with life and with the release of Tekken Tag Tournament 2 he decided to wholly dedicate himself to the game. He started watching tournaments, analyzing pro player matches, and figuring out his shortcomings.

Despite the losses it brought, he kept improving until achieving success, most notably, winning The King of Iron Fist Tournament 2016 using Jack. Saint himself thinks that his character choice has something to do with a passion for the wrestling game he once played as a kid.
Unlike his longtime friend and teammate JDCR, Saint is also known for extensively modding his fight sticks, tuning them to perfection and making sure everything is just right. He even goes as far as trying out new parts while playing in tournaments, since the high stakes environment provides a true test of the ergonomics.

This world-renowned player used to be a below-average student in school attending extra classes outside of the curriculum. This led to a lot of stress which he blew off at the arcade, finding an outlet in Tekken. The game made him forget about the stress and was something he was confident about. This continued even after he was done with middle school.
Nobi became so obsessed with Tekken that he'd skip classes to play the game until he ended up dropping out of high school to play. He did homeschooling online and later applied for a programming degree in a university but had to quit it as well cause he was too obsessed with Tekken. At that point, he was already competing in local tournaments and making a name for himself which steadily grew into a career in fighting games and becoming one of the best players in the world and Japan especially.

After graduating high school Saint stated considering a career in fighting games and competing in tournaments around the time Tekken 5: Dark Ressurection was becoming popular. At this time Saint was still considering what to do with life and with the release of Tekken Tag Tournament 2 he decided to wholly dedicate himself to the game. He started watching tournaments, analyzing pro player matches, and figuring out his shortcomings.

Despite the losses it brought, he kept improving until achieving success, most notably, winning The King of Iron Fist Tournament 2016 using Jack. Saint himself thinks that his character choice has something to do with a passion for the wrestling game he once played as a kid.
Unlike his longtime friend and teammate JDCR, Saint is also known for extensively modding his fight sticks, tuning them to perfection and making sure everything is just right. He even goes as far as trying out new parts while playing in tournaments, since the high stakes environment provides a true test of the ergonomics.
