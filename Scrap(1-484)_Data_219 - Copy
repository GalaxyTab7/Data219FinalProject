MKLeo's relationship with Super Smash Bros began early on as his brother ran local tournaments, while his cousins were some of the best Smash players in Mexico.
Leo's earliest victories were in Super Smash Bros Brawl at the age of 8, thereafter gaining serious recognition for knocking out Mr. R, who was a runner-up at the EVO 2016 tournament Super Smash Bros event, at the Smash Factor 4 tournament. After that, Leo's consistency improved with getting 5th place at the Get On My Level 2016 tournament, then winning Smash Factor 5 and Canada Cup 2016.
However, Leo had a hurdle to cross in Super Smash Bros player ZeRo, who constantly stopped him from getting first place in tournaments they both were participants in. This changed after the 2GGT Zero Saga tournament where he got the better of his long-time rival and ended up winning the event. This set him further on the path of becoming the best Smash player in the world. While ZeRo still won many sets against Leo, Leo ended up beating ZeRo in another 2GGT tournament, not long after ZeRo retired from competitive Smash, drawing the rivalry to a close.
The release of Super Smash Bros Ultimate marked a bit of a slump in MKLeo's performance but that all changed when he settled into playing Joker. Initially, it was a challenge because Joker is very different from his normal characters, like Lucina, Ike, Meta Knight, or Wolf, but once he got control of the character, he made Joker look broken. In the 2021 SWT: Central America Ultimate Regional Finals, Leo's use of Byleth during the event upheld the opinion of the character being an unlikely high tier.  
Some of Leo's achievements include winning GENESIS 4 and 5, Umebura Japan Major, DreamHack Atlanta 2017, Smash Factor 6, Super Smash Con 2017/2018, and 2GG: Kongo Saga among many others.

Jae-Min ""Knee"" Bae — Tekken 7 player from Seoul, the Republic of Korea (South Korea). He was born on June 25, 1985. Knee is often regarded as one of the best players in Tekken history. He is currently signed with ROX Dragons.
Knee was always a fan of fighting games and used to play anything he could get his hands onto. However, with time, other franchises started to fade away or lose their presence in arcades while Tekken was going strong, which made Knee focus mainly on the Tekken franchise. Back then the concept of a professional player didn't really exist so Knee's main goal was ""to be the best in Korea"".
Eventually, Knee overshot that goal, becoming not just the best player in Korea but the best in the world, until finding a formidable rival in the face of Arslan Ash.
Even then, there's no player out there who can compare with Knee's extensive record of victories, game knowledge, and character mastery. One of his famous strengths is being able to play a wide variety of characters at high-level tournaments. While Bryan is his main and long time favorite character, Knee has been seen using Devil Jin, Steve, Paul, Feng, Dragunov, and many others during major events. Be it Tekken 5, Tekken Tag Tournament 2 or Tekken 7, he always remained a consistently fearsome competitor.
Some of his best results include winning EVO 2013, EVO Japan 2018, Combo Breaker 2018/2019, Tokyo Tekken Masters 2018, 2nd place at EVO 2016 and 2019. However, even when Knee doesn't take the 1st or top 3 placement, it's still rare for him to end up outside of top 8 for any tournament he enters.

Before fighting games, Bonchan's job was mahjong. At some point, he started working at the same mahjong parlour as Daigo Umehara. Daigo wasn't active at that period in time, but Bonchan played a lot of SF and knew who he was. This led to them casually hanging out and playing Street Fighter and becoming friends. Daigo and his group of friends were surprised at how good Bonchan was at the game for a random acquaintance from a mahjong parlour. Eventually, he got fed up with mahjong and decided to step into professional gaming. Bonchan's playstyle is similar to his lifestyle. He's a calm, patient, and goal-oriented person. In real life that translated to him setting a goal for himself and working towards it with diligence and dedication. During the game, it shows in his defensive plays that seek to condition his opponent and calculated decisions that led to many impressive comebacks.

JDCR was just 8 years old when he first visited the arcade and gained a passion for fighting games. At first, he played the King of Fighters series until KoF 2000. His interest in Tekken began when he was 14 years old when his brother introduced him to Tekken Tag Tournament. That's also when he came up with his nickname, ""JDCR"" an abbreviation of a Korean phrase that denotes him playing many characters. At some point, JDCR became so good at the game that he would get beaten up in real life for constantly beating other people in the game, but he didn't let that discourage him.
At the age of 20, JDCR started entering local tournaments and by 22, he had won a regional qualifier that would allow him to compete at a major tournament in Hong Kong. Despite being drafted for conscription service, he was allowed to travel for the tournament and ended up winning it. This kickstarted his competitive career, as he received many invitations for other tournaments. As a result, much of his military service was spent competing in Tekken.
After that, he kept competing while finishing his chemistry degree in college. At some point after his graduation, Echo Fox called JDCR and he signed up to become a professional fighting games player.
JDCR proved himself to be an amazing competitor with an impressive record behind his back. He was a champion at EVO 2017, Combo Breaker 2017, NorCal StrongStyle 6, Electric Cancel 2019, DreamHack Montreal 2019, and others. On top of that, he has many top 4 and top 8 finishes in major tournaments including 3rd place at EVO 2021 Online Tekken 7 - Asia East and Season 1 of WePlay Ultimate Fighting League Tekken 7.
One of his defining features is a high level of execution, fundamentals, and game knowledge, which allowed him to achieve good results with off-meta characters like Armor King and Heihachi, both of which rarely see play in big tournaments.

At some point, he needed a PSN name and wanted to use the name of Dragon Ball character - Super Kami Guru. As it was taken, he had to find something similar and landed on Super Akouma.
Before great Pakistani players were introduced to the Tekken scene in 2019, Super Akouma was basically the only one who represented the character in professional play. The highlight of his performance with the character is the amazing comeback during The MIXUP 2019 tournament, where on a last pixel of health, he performed an incredibly damaging, high execution combo while playing against Chikurin. That match alone brought a lot of attention to Akuma's strength and demands to nerf the character.
