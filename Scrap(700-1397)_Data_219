Japanese fighting game player Naoto ""sako"" Sako, also known as sakonoko is one of the ""five gods"" of Japanese Street Fighter, with several wins under his belt that span multiple titles in the franchise. As a result, his mains have changed over the years, but in 2019 sako dropped his Chun-Li for Akuma.
Sako is a Capcom Cup 2013 champion (Street Fighter IV) who represents FAV gaming. He's mainly known for being an execution master, making the execution of complicated combos look easy. Other fighting games he's had success in are Darkstalkers, Guilty Gear XX, Hyper Street Fighter II, and Street Fighter III: Third Strike. However, it was across the different iterations of Street Fighter IV that sako truly shone, inspiring the term Sako Combo for his execution of complicated Evil Ryu combos at major events when the pressure was high. Sako maintains this impeccable consistency and high execution while being over 40 years old, shattering the preconceptions about retirement age for FGC players.
This proficiency led to HORI taking input from sako when designing their Hayabusa fighting stick parts. Hayabusa lever and buttons are usually noted for their low resistance and precision. 
Besides Akuma and Chun-Li, the master of execution has mained Menat, another Street Fighter V character with big execution requirements to play. sako's Street Fighter V accolades include a 1st place finish at SoCal Regionals 2018, 5-6th place finish at Fighter's Spirit 2019, and a 3rd place finish at EVO Japan 2020.

This world-renowned player used to be a below-average student in school attending extra classes outside of the curriculum. This led to a lot of stress which he blew off at the arcade, finding an outlet in Tekken. The game made him forget about the stress and was something he was confident about. This continued even after he was done with middle school.
Nobi became so obsessed with Tekken that he'd skip classes to play the game until he ended up dropping out of high school to play. He did homeschooling online and later applied for a programming degree in a university but had to quit it as well cause he was too obsessed with Tekken. At that point, he was already competing in local tournaments and making a name for himself which steadily grew into a career in fighting games and becoming one of the best players in the world and Japan especially.

Daigo took an interest in fighting games early on. When he was just 10 years old he saw Street Fighter 2 arcade cabinet at a video rental store and it caught his eye. After that, he started going to arcades to play fighting games. Daigo didn't have a natural talent for fighting games but what he had is passion. He was convinced that he can win if he converts that passion into practicing and learning. This conviction would bear fruit as later on Daigo established a legendary record of having 286 win streak in Darkstalkers, only stopping because game center was closing.
The late 90s were filled with competition for Daigo, ramping up from regional to international wins when he traveled to the USA in 1998 for Street Fighter Alpha 3 tournament, where he defeated American champion, Alex Valle and won his first international championship.
While Umehara always played a variety of games, Street Fighter was always his key discipline. This culminated in EVO 2004 where he accomplished what most would consider almost impossible. In a Daigo vs Justin Wong fight, he made an incredible comeback by parrying Chun-Li's 16 hit super, which was the only option he had, because blocking would lead to chip out death. This event is now known as EVO moment 37. The same year, Daigo was unsure if he should continue playing fighting games and almost withdrawn from the community to pursue a career in elder care instead. 
Street Fighter IV release is what started drawing Daigo back into the competition and before long, he once against entered competitions, even attending and winning EVO 2009 which led to him finally becoming a sponsored player under MAD CATZ. The following year he won again at EVO 2010.
While his performance in Street Fighter V hasn't been as dominant, he remains a very intimidating opponent for other players with many top 4 and top 8 placements and incredible plays. Despite Daigo's age, which is above the average of other SF pros, he still learns and improves.
In 2016 Daigo Umehara published a book called ""The Will to Keep Winning"" that served as a peek inside the mind of a champion. It recounts both his personal life and professional career and allows people to understand his mentality that led to becoming one of the greatest fighting game players of all time.

He got into video games at a very young age, by his own admission going to arcades with his brother when he was just 3 years old. He used to go to arcades throughout the years, playing Street Fighter and later on Tekken Tag Tournament 1. After graduating high school Saint stated considering a career in fighting games and competing in tournaments around the time Tekken 5: Dark Ressurection was becoming popular. At this time Saint was still considering what to do with life and with the release of Tekken Tag Tournament 2 he decided to wholly dedicate himself to the game. He started watching tournaments, analyzing pro player matches, and figuring out his shortcomings.
Despite competitive ambition, Saint's character choices are unique as his most recognisable mains are Ganryu and Jack. Despite the losses it brought, he kept improving until achieving success, most notably, winning The King of Iron Fist Tournament 2016 using Jack. Saint himself thinks that his character choice has something to do with a passion for the wrestling game he once played as a kid.
Unlike his longtime friend and teammate JDCR, Saint is also known for extensively modding his fight sticks, tuning them to perfection and making sure everything is just right. He even goes as far as trying out new parts while playing in tournaments, since the high stakes environment provides a true test of the ergonomics.

He's recognized as one of the best Tekken players in North America and coined the infamous ""no round brown"" phrase after the infamous FT5 set against RealLaw. He currently represents Nfinite.
Pokchop's introduction was Tekken 2 but only really got into the game with Tekken 3 with help of his cousin. Even though many know him as a strong Bryan and Bruce player, he always liked Bruce Lee inspired characters, like Tekken's Law or Street Fighter's Fei Long.
With Tekken 4 Ricky started to get into a competitive side of Tekken and mainly focused on Bryan despite Law being his favourite. This trend of character choices continued with him later picking up Bruce in Tekken 5. 
Outside of fighting games, Pokchop also plays chess and said that sometimes it affects how he plays Tekken. Whether due to chess or not, it definitely comes through in his playstyle as Pokchop has a very sharp and strategic approach to matches. Even casual players will notice this as he quickly adapts to his opponents in both offence and defence. This makes Pokchop's matches a thrill to watch as tides can turn at any moment no matter what level of opponent he faces.
Some of his best results include 1st place at The Fall Classic 2018, 2nd place at DreamHack Atlanta 2018, 3rd place at The Fall Classic 2017, 4th place at Final Round 2019, 4th place at Kumite in Tennessee 2019, and 5th place at Summer Jam 12.
